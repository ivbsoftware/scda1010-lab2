## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


```{r}
library(readr)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(rpart)
library(rpart.plot)
library(Amelia)
library(rattle)
library(RColorBrewer)
library(caret)
```

## Wine quality dataset

source: http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Wine+Quality

```
| class values

quality (score between 0 and 10)

| attributes

fixed acidity
volatile acidity
citric acid
residual sugar
chlorides
free sulfur dioxide
total sulfur dioxide
density
pH
sulphates
alcohol

```

```{r}
winequality_red <- read.csv("http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/wine-quality/winequality-red.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ";")

```

## Data Set exploration and cleaning

```{r}
set.seed(77)
dim(winequality_red)
head(winequality_red)
```

### Data structure
```{r}
str(winequality_red)
```

### Data summary
```{r}
summary(winequality_red)
```



# Checking missing values (missing values or empty values)

```{r}
colSums(is.na(winequality_red)|winequality_red=='')
```

#Visualization of missing values

```{r}
missmap(winequality_red, main="winequality_red - Missings Map",
        col=c("yellow", "black"))
```

## Visualize the distribution of quality

```{r}
winequality_red$quality <- as.factor(winequality_red$quality)
ggplot(data = winequality_red, mapping = aes(x = quality)) +
  geom_bar()
```



## wine quality based on density

```{r}
ggplot(winequality_red,aes(density, quality,fill = quality))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "blue", outlier.shape = 1, notch = T)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("wine quality based on density")
```


## wine quality based on density and pH

```{r}
ggplot(winequality_red,aes(density, pH,fill = quality))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "blue", outlier.shape = 1, notch = F)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("wine quality based on density and pH")
```

## wine quality based on alcohol

```{r}
ggplot(winequality_red,aes(alcohol, quality,fill = alcohol))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "blue", outlier.shape = 1, notch = T)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("wine quality based on alcohol")
```

## wine quality based on density and alcohol

```{r}
ggplot(winequality_red,aes(alcohol, density, fill = quality))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "blue", outlier.shape = 1, notch = F)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("wine quality based on alcohol and density")
```


## wine quality based on residual sugar and fixed acidity

```{r}
ggplot(winequality_red,aes(residual.sugar, fixed.acidity, fill = quality))+
  geom_boxplot(outlier.colour = "blue", outlier.shape = 1, notch = F)+
  coord_flip()+
  ggtitle("wine quality based on residual sugar and fixed acidity")
```


ggplot(data = winequality_red, mapping = aes(x = alcohol, fill = quality)) +
  geom_histogram(binwidth = 5)


## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
